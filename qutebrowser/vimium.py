# Vimium parity: the same keyboard shortcuts and search keywords as
# firefox/vimium-options.json, expressed in qutebrowser's syntax.
#
# Sourced from config.py. Two syntax differences from Vimium:
#   * Vimium writes `map <key> <command>` lines; qutebrowser takes
#     config.bind(key, command).
#   * Vimium writes search engines as `keyword: URL Description` with a %s
#     placeholder; qutebrowser takes a dict with a {} placeholder and has no
#     room for the description.

# Vimium's scrollPageDown/scrollPageUp move by *half* a viewport (see
# ScrollPageDown in its mode_normal.js), not a whole one. Half a page is also
# qutebrowser's own default for these keys, and J/K already default to
# next/previous tab, so all four lines below only pin behaviour that coincides;
# they are written out to keep the parity explicit.
# config.bind("J", "tab-next")                 # vimium: map J nextTab
# config.bind("K", "tab-prev")                 # vimium: map K previousTab
# config.bind("<Ctrl+d>", "scroll-page 0 0.5")  # vimium: map <c-d> scrollPageDown
# config.bind("<Ctrl+u>", "scroll-page 0 -0.5") # vimium: map <c-u> scrollPageUp
